### 3 Awesome visualizaion techniques

Visualizations are awesome. However, a good visualization is annoyingly hard to make.

Moreover, it takes time and effort when it comes to present these visualizations to a bigger audience.

We all know how to make Bar-Plots, Scatter Plots, and Histograms, yet we don’t pay much attention to beautify them.

This hurts us — our credibility with peers and managers. You won’t feel it now, but it happens.

Also, I find it essential to reuse my code. Every time I visit a new dataset do I need to start again? Some reusable ideas of graphs that can help us to find information about the data FAST.

In this post, I am also going to talk about 3 cool visual tools:

Categorical Correlation with Graphs,
Pairplots,
Swarmplots and Graph Annotations using Seaborn.
