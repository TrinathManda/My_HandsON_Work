### Some Background Info

The sinking of the RMS Titanic in the early morning of 15 April 1912, four days into the ship's maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City, was one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history, killing more than 1,500 people.
The largest passenger liner in service at the time, Titanic had an estimated 2,224 people on board when she struck an iceberg in the North Atlantic. 
The ship had received six warnings of sea ice but was travelling at near maximum speed when the lookouts sighted the iceberg. 
Unable to turn quickly enough, the ship suffered a glancing blow that buckled the starboard (right) side and opened five of sixteen compartments to the sea. 
The disaster caused widespread outrage over the lack of lifeboats, lax regulations, and the unequal treatment of the three passenger classes during the evacuation.
Inquiries recommended sweeping changes to maritime regulations, leading to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (1914), which continues to govern maritime safety.

## DATA
The dataset consists of the information about people boarding the famous RMS Titanic. Various variables present in the dataset includes data of age, sex, fare, ticket etc.
The dataset comprises of 891 observations of 12 columns. Below is a table showing names of all the columns and their description.

## PROJECT ANALYSIS
- Please refer the jupyter notebook below on analysis part




## CONCLUSIONS

- With the help of this notebook we learnt how exploratory data analysis can be carried out using Pandas plotting.
- Also we have seen making use of packages like __matplotlib and seaborn__ to develop better insights about the data.<br/>
- We have also seen how __preproceesing__ helps in dealing with _missing_ values and irregualities present in the data. We also learnt how to _create new features_ which will in turn help us to better predict the survival. 
- We also make use of __pandas profiling__ feature to generate an html report containing all the information of the various features present in the dataset.
- We have seen the impact of columns like _Age, Embarked, Fare, SibSp and Parch_ on the rate of survival.
- The most important inference drawn from all this analysis is, we get to know what are the __features on which survival is highly positively and negatively coorelated with.__ 
- This analysis will help us to choose which __machine learning model__ we can apply to predict survival of test dataset. 

- __76%__ of __females__ survived.
- __57%__ of __children__ also survived.
- Only __16%__ of __males__ survived.
Also the survival rate for male is very low irrespective of the __class__ he belongs to and the __survival rate is less__ for all the __3rd class passengers.__ 
Almost all women in Pclass 1 and 2 survived and nearly all men in Pclass 2 and 3 died.
